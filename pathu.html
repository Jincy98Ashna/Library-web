      <p id="para">Ever since Basheer first left home to participate in the salt satyagraha at Kozhikode Ever since Basheer first left home to participate in the salt satyagraha at Kozhikode, he had led a <br> wanderer's life; Ottaanthadi, muchaanvayaru. Only occasionally did he return to his home at Thalayolapparambu, with the intention of penning down his thoughts in interludes of tranquility. <br> Next to the house where he grew up, in the same compound, he had a walled-in plot with a small house. He built this retreat himself, and around the house he planted a garden. This gate <br> was always closed, and he required silence and peace of mind. He would sit and write or walk around his garden tending to his beloved plants.</p>
